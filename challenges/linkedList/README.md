# Challenge Summary-06
**a challenge for inserting nodes, in multiple places before and after a specific node at the end or the beginnin.**
## Challenge Description
_insert nodes at the end or before or after a specific node._

## Approach & Efficiency
**the append(), insertBefore() and insertAfter() methods are added to the class to append nodes, or adding them in a specific location.**

# Challenge Summary-07

**a challenge for looping through the linked list in a reverse manner, get the correct values, and checks for abstract situations.**

## Challenge Description

**function that accept an array and number, then push this number to the middle of array**

## Approach & Efficiency
### What are linked lists?
- Linear chain of Nodes
- Usually just contains a property caled head
 - Head is a Node
our approuch is very straight forward method of breaking the problem into a smaller blocks, 
## Approach & Efficiency
the approach was eliminating the edge cases first, then checking for linked lists length then arrange then on alternating fashion.

### Big O
   #### mergeList()
   time O (n)
   space O (1)
time is a big O(n), because there is a while loop that will loop through the linked list, but this while loop swap b
