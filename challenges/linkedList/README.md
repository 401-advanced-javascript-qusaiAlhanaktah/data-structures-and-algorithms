## Approach & Efficiency
### What are linked lists?

- Usually just contains a property caled head
 - Head is a Node
our approuch is very straight forward method of breaking the problem into a smaller blocks, 
## Approach & Efficiency
the insert(), inculdes() and toSrting() methods are added to the class to append nodes, or adding them in a specific location. 
### Big O
   #### insert():
    time O (1)
    space O (1)
    no iteration is done is the Big O(1) is present.
   
   #### inculdes():
    time O (1)
    space O (n)
    higher order functions are used.
   #### toSrting():
   time O (1)
   space O (n)
   higher order functions are used.
