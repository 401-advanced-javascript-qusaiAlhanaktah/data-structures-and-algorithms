the append(), insertBefore() and insertAfter() methods are added to the class to append nodes, or adding them in a specific location. 
### Big O
   #### append():
    time O (1)
    space O (n)
    no iteration is done is the Big O(1) is present.
   
   #### insertBefore():
    time O (2)
    space O (n)
