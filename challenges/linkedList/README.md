# Challenge Summary-07

**a challenge for looping through the linked list in a reverse manner, get the correct values, and checks for abstract situations.**

## Challenge Description

**function that accept an array and number, then push this number to the middle of array**

## Approach & Efficiency
### What are linked lists?
- Linear chain of Nodes
- Usually just contains a property caled head
 - Head is a Node
our approuch is very straight forward method of breaking the problem into a smaller blocks, 
## Approach & Efficiency
the llkthFromEnd(), is a method built by using while loop, and if statements. to loop through the array in a reverse manner. 
### Big O
   #### llkthFromEnd():
   time O (2)
   space O (n)
   higher order functions are used.
